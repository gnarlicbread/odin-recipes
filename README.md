# odin-recipes
A practice website to test html fundamentals

The purpose of this website is to practice html syntax, file management with command line, and git commits. Html boilerplate, use of basic tags (<a>,<ul>,<ol>,<img>,etc.), Bash, directories, and Git Commit are to be expected. 

This README file will serve as a working journal of my progress through this exercise.

    -Already ran into a hurdle. Tried to commit README file to github but am not seeing the updated file. 

    -Okay. I figured it out. Issue came from not using git push to upload work to repository

    Added index.html and a recipes directory

    Added image directory and images and 3 html files into recipes directory 

    Added ingredients, directions, and image to cinnamon_roll_monkey_bread.html

    Added ingredients,directions, and images to marry_me_chicken_soup.html

    Added final information to beef_stroganoff.html

    Will git push final product
