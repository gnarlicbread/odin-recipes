A practice website to test html fundamentals

The purpose of this website is to practice html syntax, file management with command line, and git commits. Html boilerplate, use of basic tags (<a>,<ul>,<ol>,<img>,etc.), Bash, directories, and Git Commit are to be expected. 

This README file will serve as a working journal of my progress through this exercise.

    -Already ran into a hurdle. Tried to commit README file to github but am not seeing the updated file. 

    -Okay. I figured it out. Issue came from not using git push to upload work to repository
